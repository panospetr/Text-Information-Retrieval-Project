 carcinoma of the esophagus a survey of fifty-seven patients with cancer of the esophagus occurring over a twenty year period is presented.  the presenting complaints of the disease, methods of diagnosis, and characteristics of the disease are discussed.  three equal treatment groups consisting of no treatment, x-ray treatment, and surgical resection were compared and the results were extremely poor.  only one patient in all three groups survived longer than two years.  it was our conclusion, supported by the opinion of others, that x-ray therapy gave the best palliation in most cases and that surgical resection for cure should be used in only the most suitable patients.

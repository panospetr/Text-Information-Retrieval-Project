 2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis, and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian) in patients with chronic fibrocavernous tuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-allergic side reactions to antibacterial therapy, chronic foci or infection and diseases with an allergic component can contribute to the development of amyloidosis.  the early detection and clearing of chronic foci of infection and effective measures against even mildly pronounced toxic-allergic side reactions are of prime importance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  the unsystematic and prolonged administration of antibacterial preparations, along with their toxic side effects, tends to increase the incidence of amyloidosis in patients with chronic fibrocavernous pulmonary tb.  individual constitutional factors are of great importance in the development of side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations, in cases of hypofunction of the liver and kidneys and autonomic dysfunction promote the development of dystrophic processes, as is confirmed by the high frequency of toxic-allergic reactions in patients with fibrocavernous pulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis. the administration of desensitizing drugs to patients showing side reactions therefore helps to prevent amyloidosis in cases of chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemotherapy should be automatically combined with the administration of desensitizing and stimulatory drugs in this class of case.

 concurrence of hyperplasia and neoplasia of the parathyroid glands the concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasia and neoplasia in a group of six patients is reported.  two patients had long-standing renal disease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia. in both hypercalcemia developed while they were under observation and they were found to have parathyroid adenomas as well as hyperplasia of the other glands.  a third patient followed an apparently similar course.  one patient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to a large mediastinal adenoma displayed hyperplasia of other glands in association with moderate renal insufficiency.  two patients with primary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia were found to have superimposed neoplastic lesions: multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocarcinoma in the other. these observations add new dimensions to the diagnosis and therapy of parathyroid disorders. they indicate the necessity of examining all four parathyroid areas at time of surgery.  they also emphasize that hypercalcemia developing in patients with chronic renal disease is a manifestation of autonomous parathyroid function.

 dural sinus pressure in normal and hydrocephalic dogs simultaneous measurement of cerebrospinal fluid pressure (csfp) and venous pressure in the anterior (ssvp) and posterior sagittal sinus (tvp) has demonstrated that in the normal dog the mean pressures are related as follows: csfp>ssvp>tvp.  the statistical relationship between the pressures has shown a poor correlation of ssvp and tvp with changes in csfp.  on the other hand, in the hydrocephalic dog, ssvp rises to meet csfp and is related to fluid pressure in a 1:1 fashion.  this could be expected to cause a "non venting" of acute changes of csfp and a decrease in fluid absorption.  it is postulated that the mechanism of ssvp elevation is a partial occlusion of the sinus.

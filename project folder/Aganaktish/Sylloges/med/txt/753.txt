 red cell glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency--a newly recognized cause of neonatal jaundice and kernicterus in canada seven male newborns of chinese, greek and italian origin presented with severe hemolytic jaundice due to red cell glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (g-6-pd) deficiency.  in five, the hemolysis was precipitated by inhalation of mothball vapours in the home.  kernicterus was evident upon admission in six infants and was fatal in four of these. g-6-pd deficiency should be suspected as a cause of jaundice in all full-term male infants of these ethnic groups.  the diagnosis can be confirmed in any hospital by the methemoglobin reduction test.  in areas similar to toronto, canada, where these high-risk ethnic groups prevail, the following measures are recommended: (1) detection of g-6-pd deficient newborns by screening cord bloods of all infants of these ethnic groups: (2) protection of affected infants from potentially hemolytic agents such as naphthalene, certain vitamin k preparations, and sulfonamides; and (3) observation of serum bilirubin levels to assess the need for exchange transfusion for hyperbilirubinemia.

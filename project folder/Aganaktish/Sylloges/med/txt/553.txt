 role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property of parathyroid extract studies were carried out to determine the action of hepatectomy on the glycoprotein action of pte as well as on pte-induced renal calcification and deposition of glycoprotein.  our data showed that in hepatectomized rats, pte no longer caused an elevation in serum glycoproteins.  however, hepatectomy did not alter the formation of glycoprotein tubular casts produced by pte administration.  the data suggest that the liver is the major source of the elevated serum glycoproteins found in rats receiving pte.  in addition, it is possible that pte may have a direct stimulating action on biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.

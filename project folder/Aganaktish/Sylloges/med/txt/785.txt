 chlorambucil-prednisolone therapy for disseminated breast carcinoma over a 7 1/2-year period, 71 patients with disseminated breast cancer were treated with combined alkylating-agent-corticosteroid therapy.  chlorambucil and prednisolone were the drugs of choice.  these agents, administered orally, produced no serious or disagreeable toxic effects.  twenty-four patients (33.8%) had objective regression of six months' duration or longer; average survival time after therapy was 23.9 months.  results are statistically similar to those obtained with sex-steroid and endocrine-ablation therapy, presumably because the three modalities have a similar mechanism of action, ie. suppression and/or eradication of endogenous estrogen.

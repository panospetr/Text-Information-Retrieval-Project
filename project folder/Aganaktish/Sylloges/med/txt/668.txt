 cell proliferation in experimental hydronephrosis and compensatory renal hyperplasia mitosis counts and autoradiographic counts of nuclei labeled with tritiated thymidine were made in the renal cortex of male rats in which the left ureter was ligated.  these were compared with corresponding counts in the remaining kidney after left nephrectomy, and in shamoperated controls 24, 48 and 72 hours after operation.  the cortex of the kidney on the obstructed side showed a greater number of tritiumlabeled nuclei and mitotic figures than in the kidney undergoing compensatory hyperplasia.  epithelial and interstitial cells responded simultaneously on the obstructed side, whereas in the remaining kidney after nephrectomy, the epithelial response preceded a slight interstitial response by 48 hours.  the contralateral kidney in rats subjected to ureteral ligation showed no response. we concluded that the early response of increased dna synthesis and cell division in the obstructed kidney was not mediated by humoral factors; it was localized and probably had a different mechanism than the proliferative response occurring in compensatory renal hyperplasia.

 1520. multiplication of bacteriophages the reproduction of bacteriophages requires the participation of bacterial metabolism.  synthesis of the viral protein components is accomplished by the same mechanism as ordinarily produces bacterial proteins; however, for the synthesis of nucleic acids (dna or rna) enzymes may be required which are not present in noninfected bacteria; their formation is then induced by the virus itself.  the fundamental biological processes of replication, transcription and translation are discussed in this context.

 management of advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesterone acetate a basis for progestin therapy for patients with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma is presented.  the criteria for selection of patients for hormone therapy and the schedule of administration of medroxyprogesterone (provera) is discussed.  evaluation of patients for objective changes only, i.e., by visual, palpable, histologic, or roentgenologic means, revealed complete or partial remission with significant palliation in 8 of 20 patients (40 per cent).  response to medroxyprogesterone therapy is apparently related to degree of differentiation of the primary neoplasm, the well-differentiated lesions being more responsive.  documentation of tumor effect by serial biopsies during treatment provides an index to the histologic changes this progestin produces in susceptible cases.  the effects of therapy upon serial urinary hormone excretion rates is documented in several patients. on the basis of our experience, the treatment of patients with advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma with the potent progestin medroxyprogesterone seems justified.

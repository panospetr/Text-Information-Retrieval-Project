 the autistic child the conditions most frequently mistaken for autism are speech disorder, brain damage and mental deficiency, each a prominent symptom of the psychotic child.  careful history and close observation to disclose symptoms of withdrawal, lack of ego, compulsion for sameness, and displays of intelligence give incomplete clues to the diagnosis. the etiology of autism is uncertain.  several factors seem significant.  the important role of organic damage of the brain is underscored by the coincidence of epilepsy, eeg and neurological abnormalities in these children.  in our series seizures of various types occurred in 25%, eeg abnormalities in 58%, and minor neurological deficits in 70% of the cases.  environmental factors are quite obviously important in many instances.  the emotional and behavioral pattern of the parents toward the infant is often incriminated. separation, inattention, coldness, rejection, etc. have been found in many situations.  familial incidence of psychoses is low; so is that of autism in siblings.

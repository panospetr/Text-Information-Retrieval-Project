 1991. ventricular septal defect with aortic regurgitation. medical and pathologic aspects thirty-four patients with ventricular septal defect and aortic regurgitation, representing less than 5% of the patients with ventricular septal defect, are discussed. a loud, systolic murmur, characteristic of ventricular septal defect, is noted during infancy, whereas evidences of aortic regurgitation (protodiastolic murmur and wide pulse pressure) does not usually appear until some time between 2 and 10 years of age.  clinical and catheterization data indicate that the principal hemodynamic load is aortic regurgitation, whereas the ventricular septal defect does not usually result in a large pulmonary blood flow or high pulmonary arterial pressure. in about 50% of the patients, a significant pressure gradient across the right ventricular outflow tract exists.  detailed pathologic studies indicate that the ventricular septal defects are high and anterior and encroach to a greater or lesser degree on the membranous bulbar septum.  the right coronary cusp is the one most severely involved, and, by its prolapse, causes aortic regurgitation; the noncoronary cusp is always less severely affected.  the anatomic basis of the pressure gradient observed across the right ventricular outflow tract is not always clear.

 gastrointestinal ulceration and central nervous system lesions there is both a real and an apparent increase in the incidence of severe gastrointestinal ulceration due to central nervous lesions.  some of this increased incidence reflects recently devised iatrogenic measures including new drugs and surgical therapy. in adults, cerebrovascular lesions are the commonest single cause of acute peptic ulceration found at autopsy.  in children, we found 25 instances of upper gastrointestinal ulceration due to central nervous system lesions in 1,750 autopsies.  two general anatomical categories could be recognized: acute ulceration and malacias. a variety of causative central nervous system lesions was responsible in these 25 cases, the commonest being bacterial meningitis. other causes were poliomyelitis, brain tumor, hydrocephalus, etc.  theories of pathogenesis are presented. more experience with both drug and surgical therapy is needed.  the recent development of local freezing techniques offers promise for reduction of mortality.

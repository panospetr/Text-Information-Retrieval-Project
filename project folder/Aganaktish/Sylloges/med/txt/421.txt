 974. extracorporeal hypothermia without thoracotomy.  an experimental study in the use of cold for neurosurgery and cancericidal perfusions this paper includes minor clinical notes on open heart surgery and cancer perfusion but contains no experimental information on neurosurgery or cancer perfusions.  a method of closed-chest hypothermic perfusion in 30 dogs is reported.  the authors utilize drainage of superior and inferior cavae by gravity.  the volume of venous drainage sometimes enhanced by transfusions or 12.5% low molecular weight dextran determined the flow rate.  cooling was maintained for quite variable periods apparently generally to an unspecified esophageal temperature.  perfusion time varied from 30 min. to 4 hr.  animals with low flows were perfused longer, had a higher incidence of ventricular fibrillation, and a very low survival rate.  eleven animals survived.  all had pre-cooling flow rates above 40 ml./kg./min., good flow rates during the perfusion, and only 3 had ventricular fibrillation.  flow rates and survival were increased in animals receiving low molecular weight dextran.  fourteen of 15 animals with ventricular fibrillation were defibrillated electrically, 8 regained 'adequate' cardiac function, but only 3 survived.  some interesting data on regional cooling of the lower half of the body is presented.  the authors conclude without sufficient evidence that the most important factor in the mortality in hypothermic perfusion is the ability to maintain 'a flow rate approaching the estimated normothermic cardiac output of the animal'

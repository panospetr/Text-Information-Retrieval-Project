 pathogenesis of polycystic kidneys microdissection confirms our previous description of an uncommon variety of polycystic kidney found only in the newborn periods.  it is characterized by symmetrical enlargement caused by saccular or cylindrical increase in size of all collecting tubules. the number and relative length of different generations of collecting tubules are normal. nephrons are present in normal numbers, and their attachment to collecting tubules is normal.  the pattern of the nephrons is normal except for minimal localized areas of dilatation.  interstitial connective tissue is not increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are invariably cystic.  siblings may be affected. we believe that in such kidneys the behavior of the ampullae of the branches of the ureteral bud is normal and that secondary hyperplasia of the interstitial portions of the branches is responsible for the greatly increased renal size.

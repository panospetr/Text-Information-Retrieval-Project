 bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus a rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus in a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is presented. the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspected during life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributed to either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis. after post mortem examination, it was evident that the hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretion from the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of the sylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent membrane. an interesting and uncommon additional feature of this case was the presence, within the choroidal papilloma, of well-formed haversian bone. a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma of the choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydrocephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treatment might conceivably result in total cure.

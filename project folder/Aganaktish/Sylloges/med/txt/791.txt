 sustained palliation in ovarian carcinoma management of 64 cases of advanced ovarian carcinoma has been analyzed. an attempt is made to compare the value of radiation and the value of chlorambucil, using salvage time and sustained palliation as end points. chlorambucil, an outpatient oral medication, appears to be as efficacious as radiation in advanced ovarian carcinoma. chlorambucil may be used before or after irradiation therapy. pleural and peritoneal effusion respond favorably to chlorambucil 80% of the time. the possibility of using a different dosage schedule is discussed.

 etude radiographique des genoux de 100 hemophiles de 7 a 15 ans radiographic examination of the knee were systematically performed in 100 haemophiliac subjects aged from 7 to 15 years, 64 of whom had a bilateral haemarthrosis, 30 had only one knee affected and 6 were uninjured. an intra-articular opacification, observed in 29 knees, corresponded to a recent haemarthrosis. densification of the synovial membrane was observed in 25 knees and corresponded to iron deposits. an interlinear pinch was present in 52 knees. erosions of articular surfaces are especially frequent (78 knees) or homogeneous (28 knees). hypertrophy of condyles or knee-caps, broadening of intercondylian space, crushing of internal tibial disk, genu valgum and posterior subluxation of tibia are osseous deformations that are encountered. atrophy of femur diaphysis explains the frequency of fracture of femur. some of these aspects seem to occur early (interlinear pinch, erosion of the surfaces), others are tardier (geodes, decalcification). a relation between the intensity of abnormal radiological findings and the severity of sequelae does not always exist, but one can observe major radiological alterations only when there is a major biological disturbance.

 investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis in patients with diabetes insipidus plasma sodium, osmolality and serum chloride, together with creatinine clearance, were studied before and during thiazide treatment of 7 patients with diabetes insipidus. the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%. the urine osmolality was increased by 7-128%.  an average decrease in plasma sodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolality of 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of 8 meq/i was observed.  only in one patient was the creatinine clearance reduced significantly.  the thirst-feeling was reduced even from the first day of treatment.  the diuresis was not minimal until the third to fourth day.  if the diuresis was corrected for the extra electrolyte excretion initiated by the thiazide, the antidiuresis was found to be operating to the full extent even on the first day of treatment. it is concluded that the antidiuresis is mainly secondary to the natriuresis and to a certain degree due to a decreased thirstfeeling; but there seems also to be a direct renal action, involving at least a reduction of the glomerular filtration rate.  a pronounced antidiuresis was found by a water deprivation test after thiazide treatment in one patient.

 nephrogenic diabetes insipidus chlorothiazide has been found of value in establishing and maintaining adequate hydration in some patients; its exact mechanism of action is not known.  the antidiuretic effects of chlorothiazide and its analogues have been studied in six patients with ndi, two of whom were infants less than six months of age.  dehydrated infants showed a dramatic response to treatment.  with those unable to achieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treatment, the initial beneficial response was associated with an increased fluid intake.  following this initial antidiuretic response, a variable degree of "escape" or resistance to the action of the drug commonly occurred.  despite the unpredictability of a prolonged antidiuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chlorothiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet alone is not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it must be remembered, however, that this drug is potentially toxic.

 a study of childhood schizophrenia and early infantile autism (part i--description of the sample) following a period of observation of three months' duration, a group of twelve autistic schizophrenic children were selected for a treatment program.  the group was selected on criteria which would allow a reasonable chance of successful treatment in a group homogeneous enough to allow statistical considerations to be valid. younger age, average intellectual functioning, presence of an intact family in or near to metropolitan toronto and a firm diagnosis of autistic schizophrenia were the limiting factors. rather distinct differences were noted in this treatment group as opposed to the larger observation group.  the distinguishing characteristic was undoubtedly the speech abnormalities present.

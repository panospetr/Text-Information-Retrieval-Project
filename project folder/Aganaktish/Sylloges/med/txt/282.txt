 617. maturation of postnatal human lung and the idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome maturation and pathologic alterations of the lung in 19 newborn infants who died of idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome were studied by light-and electron microscopy.  normal lungs from 6 fetuses and 11 newborns served as controls.  in all infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory bronchioles and alveolar ducts usually presented the histologic pattern of mature lungs, i.e. they were predominantly lined by type i cells, which also formed the epithelial component of most blood-air barriers.  well expanded alveoli exhibited a similar pattern, whereas collapsed alveoli were lined by numerous type ii cells which participated in the formation of poorly developed blood-air barriers.  the capacity of type ii cells to produce inclusion bodies seemed to increase with survival beyond the 14th hr of age.  secretion of inclusion bodies and presumably surfactant into alveolar spaces did occur but only in the lungs of infants older than 2 days.  however, this process was not accompanied by reduction in the number of type ii cells per alveolus as in the normal lung.  the distribution of pathologic changes in idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome appeared to be determined by the degree of maturity of the air sacs. structurally mature air sacs were associated with damage of epithelial lining and hyaline membrane formation.  in contrast, collapsed alveoli revealed an intact epithelial lining and marked septal edema but were free of hyaline membranes.  the findings of this study suggested that transudation of plasma through well developed blood-air barriers was responsible for epithelial damage and hyaline-membrane formation in air sacs. they also suggested that alveolar collapse and presumably lack of surfactant were related to abnormal maturation of the epithelial lining and to septal edema.

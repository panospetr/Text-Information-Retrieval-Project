 the natural history of autoimmune disease in nzb mice a comparison with the pattern of human autoimmune manifestations all mice of the nzb/bl strain spontaneously develop serological and pathological evidence of autoimmune disease during adult life.  the nzb/bl strain was developed by dr. marianne bielschowsky in dunedin, new zealand, by inbreeding from an outbred colony of mixed coat color.  several inbred strains--nzb, nzc, nzo, nzw, nzy, and others, have been evolved in dunedin from the original colony.  evidence for autoimmune disease in the nzb strain was first reported by bielschowsky, helyer, and howie who found evidence of an autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  the dunedin group used the presence of agglutinins for ficin-treated red cells as the index of the disease.

 1949. studies on the soluble proteins of bovine lens.  immunochemical analyses of protein fractions the lyophilized soluble lens proteins were dissolved in 0.005 m phosphate buffer at ph 6.8 and the solution was subjected to column chromatography on deae (diethylamino ethyl) cellulose.  elution was accomplished by changing the ph and ionic strength of the eluting buffer.  the components were fractionated by stepwise elution.  the lens proteins were separated into 17 fractions by column chromatography.  these fractions were compared with a, b and y crystallines for electrophoretic mobility, and the antigenic purity of each fraction was examined immunochemically.  the results showed that while the fractions were not completely pure they were purer than the a, b and y crystalline fractions, and that f-1-a, b, c and d corresponded to y crystalline, while f-2-a, b, c, d, e and f corresponded to b crystalline and f-3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to a crystalline.

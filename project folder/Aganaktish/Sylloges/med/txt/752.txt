 neonatology considerable progress has been made in the knowledge of bilirubin metabolism since the characterization of "direct" (conjugated) bilirubin as an ester glucuronide.  the metabolic pathway involved in this hepatic conjugation is now well established and has been the subject of excellent reviews by sherlock and billing. sherlock's diagrammatic representations of bilirubin metabolism (fig. 1) and of the possible mechanisms of jaundice (fig. 2) are reproduced here because they furnish a clear picture to serve as a reference point for the discussion to follow. it is interesting to re-examine current concepts of the etiology of physiologic jaundice with this diagram in mind.  jaundice may occur for a number of reasons, described below.

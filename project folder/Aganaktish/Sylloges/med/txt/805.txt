 evaluation and treatment planning for autistic children infantile autism is considered to be a reaction on the part of an immature organism at a primitive and undifferentiated stage of ego development.  little choice of defensive reactions is available; the possibility of sublimation does not exist and, even though other object relationships are gradually developing, the mother is still the child's primary object.  at this vulnerable developmental stage, a wide range of pathological circumstances, ranging from the most severe family psychopathology to the most adventitious physiological traumata or the most unfortunately malignant circumstances, may constitute an acute or cumulative catastrophic stress.  the primitive organism tends to respond to this overwhelming stress with a paranoid reaction which is directed at the mother (regardless of the actual etiological variables) because the mother is still the child's primary object.  we believe that the child then responds with an autistic reaction and shows varying degrees of simple withdrawal, obsessional behavior, magical or delusional thought processes, and consequent disruption of developmental skills, speech, and relationships with others. many families can and do make every effort to counter the paranoid reaction of the child and do not respond to his rejection with counterrejection and counterwithdrawal. some of the child's autistic symptoms may abate without formal treatment.  yet, since the mother (and family) are the primary objects of the child's paranoid attitude, it is felt that formal therapeutic intervention is necessary to modify the paranoid core of the autistic reaction.

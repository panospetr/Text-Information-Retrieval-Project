 growth hormone growth hormone influences protein, fat, carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  it promotes nitrogen retention, growth of cartilage, transportation of amino acids through the cell wall, and incorporation of amino acids into protein.  this factor mobilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissue and increases the serum concentration of these substances; long-term administration of this hormone is followed by depletion of body fat stores and inhibition of fatty acid synthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hormone administration is followed by hyperglycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effect on carbohydrate metabolism in normal subjects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, and inorganic phosphate are retained following the administration of growth hormone. hypercalciuria also accompanies such treatment, an effect mediated through the parathyroid glands. human growth hormone may be detected in the serum through the use of the radioimmunoassay.  the hypothalamus is intimately involved with the control of the secretion and release of growth hormone from the pituitary.  there is a correlation between the availability of glucose for metabolism and the plasma concentration of growth hormone; when glucose is unavailable growth hormone is released in order to provide a substitute source of energy, fatty acids. the administration of growth hormone to the patient with hypopituitarism is followed by growth in many instances, but it has not usually been effective in promoting growth in individuals with other abnormalities.  acquired resistance to the effect of growth hormone is accompanied by the development of antibodies directed against this protein.

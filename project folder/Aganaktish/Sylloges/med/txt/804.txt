 twins discordant for early infantile autism a pair of heterozygous twins discordant for early infantile autism is reported and the relevant literature reviewed.  although manifest organic factors were ruled out, the twins' physical development was different.  a specific emotional etiology was not demonstrated.  the few available twin studies offer findings consistent with the hypothesis that genetic factors are relevant to the development of childhood autism.  evidence is also presented that impaired acquisition of language may have hereditary determinants. a second set of probably homozygous twins are reported who were also discordant for autism.  this second case suggests that, although genetic factors may play a part, in some cases the syndrome of infantile autism appears to be a reversible one.  in view of this set of twins and of kanner's sibling data, the role of genetic factors remains obscure, and more twin studies properly documented with blood typing are needed.

 172. autoradiographic studies of lymphoid cells in blood and bone marrow of normal and irradiated dogs the migration, fate, and turnover of lymphoid cells in blood and bone marrow of 4 irradiated and 4 nonirradiated dogs were studied by serial autoradiography with clamping of the hind legs during the plasma clearance time of h3-thymidine injected into an anterior vein.  in irradiated dogs, the h3-thymidine injection procedure was carried out during the early recovery phase after 250 r of whole-body x-irradiation.  the results on 2 irradiated and 2 normal dogs were described in detail.  migration of lymphoid cells from blood to marrow parenchyma was confirmed in the irradiated dogs.  conclusive evidence of transformation of these cells into hemopoietic precursors was not found.  the relative number of large lymphoid cells, the labeling index of the whole population of lymphoid cells, and that of small lymphoid cells were increased in irradiated marrow; few initially labeled small lymphoid cells could also be observed.  these data indicate that the pattern of proliferation of lymphoid cells is changed in irradiated regenerating bone marrow.

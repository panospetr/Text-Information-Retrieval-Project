 a fatal septicemic disease of infant puppies caused by cytopathogenic organisms with characteristics of mycoplasma. pathogenic organisms were isolated from 2 outbreaks of a fatal septicemic disease of infant puppies and from dog kidney cells that degenerated spontaneously.  the isolates were indistinguishable serologically and possessed characteristics of mycoplasma.  the pathogenic organisms were cytopathogenic for dog kidney cell cultures, and in inoculated puppies, produced pathological changes that resembled those seen in natural cases.  lesions consisted principally of necrosis and hemorrhage.  the isolates were culturally and serologically distinct from recognized canine mycoplasma species.

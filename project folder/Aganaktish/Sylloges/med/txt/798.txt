 incidence of symptoms of early infantile autism in subsequently hospitalized psychiatric patients this study was concerned with the relationship between the occurrence during the first two years of life of symptoms of early infantile autism, as retrospectively reported by the mothers of s's and subsequent adjustment.  the mothers of 69 unmarried young hospitalized psychiatric patients were interviewed to determine the presence or absence of each of 28 different signs contained in a check list.  the signs represent characteristic features that are reportedly often found in conjunction with early infantile autism. as a control, 50 mothers of high school students residing in the community and presenting no significant adjustment problems were questioned in regard to the very same items. the results indicated that there were significantly more symptoms reported for patients than for normals, and that this finding applied to the overall number of symptoms as well as to several subcategories of symptoms.  the items classified under the heading of "social withdrawal" appeared to be the most sensitive in differentiating the groups.  it was also found that 11 of the 28 signs distinguished between the patients and normals, with all except one occurring more frequently in the former group.  it was concluded that a significant relationship existed between the reported presence of symptoms that are often associated with severe and early ego impairment and subsequent status as a mental hospital patient.  this study does not provide any direct answer to the question of what proportion of children with infantile autism are later able to make an adequate adjustment outside of a mental hospital.

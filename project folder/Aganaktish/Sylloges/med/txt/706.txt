 ventriculo-venous shunts for infantile hydrocephalus a review of 48 hydrocephalic patients treated with atrioventricular shunts during a 5-year period has been presented.  we have discussed function of the shunt, complications of the procedure, and revisions necessitated by nonfunctioning.  the overall 75 per cent survival rate and 14.3 per cent infection rate is comparable to that in other series.  the major cause of death in our patients has been infection. our experience to date supports the observation that spontaneous arrest of the hydrocephalic process does not occur once a ventriculo-venous shunt has been established. meticulous introduction of a ventriculovenous shunt appears to be the present treatment of choice for patients with severe hydrocephalus.  results are only satisfactory when the patients are carefully followed and complications recognized and treated promptly.

 pleuropneumonia-like organisms despite their small size, the pplo carry the full complement of the chemical compounds and enzymes contained in larger bacteria and in cells.  they contain both dna and rna, and in their independent metabolism they are essentially like other free living cells in contrast to the viruses which have no independent metabolism outside the living host cell.  several strains of pplo have been cultivated from the mucous membranes of apparently normal human subjects, especially from the respiratory and urinary tracts. until recently, however, definite evidence of the association between the pplo and clearly defined clinical disease in the human subject was lacking.  in 1962 it became evident that the so-called eaton "virus," originally isolated by eaton and his associates in 1944 from patients with primary atypical pneumonia, was in reality a pleuropneumonia-like organism.  typical pplo colonies are produced on a cell-free agar medium which is enriched by the addition of blood serum or yeast.  a number of strains of pplo has now been identified, and in recognition of their unique characteristics, they have been classified in a separate order, the mycoplasmatales, genus mycoplasma.

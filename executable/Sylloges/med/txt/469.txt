 3724. the bacterial induction of homograft sensitivity. ii. effects of sensitization with staphylococci and other microorganisms heat-killed strains of staph. aureus and staph. albus can induce in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with 1st-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejections of such grafts.  other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, c. xerosis, b. subtilis, e. coli, a. aerogenes, s. typhimurium, pr. vulgaris, n. catarrhalis, h. influenzae, and 2 human virulent strains of myc. tuberculosis.  none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig.  pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of 1st-set skin homografts.  results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.

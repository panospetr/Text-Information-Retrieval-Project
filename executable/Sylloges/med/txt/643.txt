 a method for direct demonstration of pleuropneumonia-like organisms in cultured cells. direct microscopic observation of pleuropneumonia-like organisms (pplo) in cell cultures is easily accomplished following hypotonic treatment, air-drying and staining with orcein.  a rapid technique using fl human amnion cells, inoculated with supernatant from suspected cultures, is described.  the demonstration of pplo contamination of 30 cell lines by this rapid method was in complete agreement with results of pplo-agar techniques.

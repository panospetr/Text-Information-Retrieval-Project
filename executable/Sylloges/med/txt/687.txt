 the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of diabetes insipidus the changes in water and electrolyte balance during hydrochlorothiazide therapy in 2 patients with vasopressindeficient diabetes insipidus were studied.  in 1 case, under fixed daily sodium intake, the urinary sodium excretion markedly increased on the first day of treatment, but the urinary volume began to fall on the second day and persisted low for 3 days after discontinuation of the drug.  in the other case the urinary volume markedly decreased when the daily sodium intake was strictly limited.  it further decreased on hydrochlorothiazide therapy but after sodium intake was restored it returned to the pretreatment level despite continued use of the drug. the antidiuretic action of hydrochlorothiazide in the treatment of diabetes insipidus is believed to be related to the sodium depletion state of the body brought about by increased output or decreased intake of sodium.  sodium and water reabsorption in the proximal convoluted tubules in the kidney increases and the amount of glomerular filtrate reaching the distal convoluted tubules decreases.  thus the final urinary volume falls.

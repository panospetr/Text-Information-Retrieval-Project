 case of salpingitis due to pleuro-pneumonalike organisms a case of acute salpingitis following a diagnostic curettage and aspiration of the pouch of douglas is described.  this case was resistant to penicillin and streptomycin therapy.  a pure culture of pleuropneumonia like organisms (pplo) grew from pus removed from the secondary pyosalpinx by aspiration.  these organisms were sensitive to tetracycline which cured the adnexal infection.  no pplo were found in the vaginal discharge. pplo have frequently been isolated from the vaginae of healthy and infected women.  however, only 9 cases of pelvic inflammatory disease with a pure culture of pplo have been reported.  the possibility that these growths of pplo in the internal genitalia followed the use of antibiotic therapy is discussed. infection with pplo should be considered when pelvic inflammatory disease proves resistant to the common antibiotics.

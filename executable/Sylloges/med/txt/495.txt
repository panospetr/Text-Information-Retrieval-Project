 9787. changes in developmental quotient under two conditions of maternal separation. developmental scales were administered to 2 groups of infants during and subsequent to a temporary period of institutionalization. although both groups experienced maternal separation, only 1 group was subjected to deprivation, in that it received very much less stimulation than the other.  results from a longitudinal testing program show that the scores of the deprived group during the period of separation were significantly lower than those of the nondeprived group, no progressive deterioration of scores took place in the course of institutionalization, immediately following return home, while the scores of the nondeprived group remained constant, those of the deprived infants jumped to the level of the other group.  3 theories regarding the mechanism underlying the association between deprivation and developmental retardation are examined and it is suggested that an explanation in motivational terms best fits the results obtained.

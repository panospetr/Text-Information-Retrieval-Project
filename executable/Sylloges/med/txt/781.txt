 polyposis of colon as seen in private practice familial polyposis of the colon may present itself in a variety of clinical entities.  from the cases discussed in this paper the following forms may be enumerated: (1) an asymptomatic phase with discrete polyposis. (2) a mildly asymptomatic stage with diffuse polyposis. (3) a premalignant phase with carcinomas in situ. (4) grossly malignant phase characterized by anemia and carcinomatosis, possibly of multicentric origin. to secure a complete cure it is imperative that the clinician discover and the surgeon treat the disease in its premalignant state. worthwhile palliative results may be obtained by surgery in incurable cases by extensive resection of the primary lesions and subsequent resection of any recurrences or metastasis, whether local or distant by second and third looks is necessary. special emphasis should be paid to the emotional problems of the patients. an encouraging, sympathetic attitude on the part of the surgeon is essential and rewarding.

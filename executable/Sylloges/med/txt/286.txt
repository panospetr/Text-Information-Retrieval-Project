 632. pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  a study using enzyme histochemistry, electron microscopy, and surface tension measurement lung biopsies from 4 patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis were studied using histochemical methods, electron microscopy, and surface tension measurement.  the lipid-rich intraalveolar fluid contained material with the staining reactions and ultrastructure of phospholipid.  although many alveoli were lined by enzymatically active, secreting granular pneumonocytes, extracts of proteinotic tissue were not surface active, and, in fact, inhibited normal surfactant.  some of the cells free in the intraalveolar material were degenerating sloughed granular pneumonocytes.  at the margins of the lesions were lipid-filled macrophages which appear to play a role in the removal of the material.  these observations indicate that alveolar proteinosis is not a primary overproduction of surfactant and are consistent with the concept that the alveolar clearing process is defective in this disease.

 effects of alkalosis on plasma concentration and urinary excretion of inorganic phosphate in man acute respiratory and metabolic alkalosis have been shown to depress plasma phosphorus concentration in normal man.  the fall in plasma phosphorus concentration is greater in respiratory than in comparable levels of extracellular metabolic alkalosis.  this fall is not attributable to increased renal excretion or to migration into red blood cells.  the evaluation of low serum phosphorus concentrations should always be carried out with a knowledge of the ph and total co2 content of the plasma.

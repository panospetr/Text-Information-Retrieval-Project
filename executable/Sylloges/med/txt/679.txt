 hyperaldosteronism, hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular complex, normal blood pressure, and dwarfism: report of a case a patient with the syndrome of hyperaldosteronism, hyperplasia of the juxtaglomerular complex, dwarfism, and normal blood pressure is reported in detail.  in this patient, the aldosterone secretion rate increased significantly and the serum potassium rose slightly with sodium deprivation.  with a low-sodium diet urinary sodium fell to zero.  spironolactone with a lowsodium diet raised serum potassium to normal.  infusion of albumin, however, resulted in a rapid increase in serum potassium and a fall in aldosterone secretion rate.  the unique features in this patient are the response to albumin and the lowering of urinary sodium to zero in response to a lowsodium intake.  in all other essentials, the case resembles the two previously reported cases.  treatment by subtotal adrenalectomy was not curative.

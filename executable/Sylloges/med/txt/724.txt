 infantile hydrocephalus and hematoma in the posterior fossa we have presented a case of hydrocephalus in an infant, the basic cause being intracranial hemorrhage in the perinatal period.  surgical removal of a hematoma in the posterior fossa did not give permanent relief of the raised intracranial pressure.  a lumbar air study at this stage disclosed information that the passage through the intracerebral cerebrospinal-fluid pathways was normalized whereas the extracerebral ones still were occluded by arachnoiditis.  the condition necessitated a ventriculo-atrial shunt.

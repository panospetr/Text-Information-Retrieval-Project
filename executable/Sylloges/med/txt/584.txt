 bone growth and metabolic studies of premature infants treated with human growth hormone the influence of exogenous human growth hormone on growth and metabolism of premature infants was observed. it was not possible to register any increase of linear bone growth after hormone administration; concomitantly urinary hydroxyproline excretion did not change significantly. nitrogen balance studies indicated a sharp increase of nitrogen retention, due to a reduced urinary excretion, in all infants. calcium and phosphorus balances rose in three out of four premature infants treated with growth hormone, but the characteristic sth calciuric action of sth was not observed.  furthermore, sth failed to induce any significant increase in nefa serum concentration of premature infants. it may therefore be concluded that the metabolic response of premature infants to sth differs consistently from that normally observed in more mature subjects.

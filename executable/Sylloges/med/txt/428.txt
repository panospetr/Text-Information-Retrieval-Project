 3831. relative ability of parental marrow to repopulate lethally irradiated f1 hybrids lethally irradiate (c57bl x 101)f1 mice injected with a mixture of 10 million c57bl and 10 million 101 bone-marrow cells were repopulated only by the 101 bone-marrow cells.  experiments with other cell mixtures indicated that the 101 marrow was relatively nine times as efficient as c57bl marrow in repopulating lethally irradiated (c57bl x 101)f1 mice. results from additional strain combinations suggested that the behavior of the donor marrows was not determined solely by h-2 factors.  c57bl marrow, which frequently regresses in irradiated f1 mice, has shown to be relatively less capable of repopulating the recipient than regularly retained parental marrow.  the differences in the relative abilities of parental marrows to repopulate f1 mice cannot as yet be fully explained.  they might be correlated with physiological differences between the parental marrows or with a microenvironmental advantage of one hematopoietic cell type over another in the irradiated recipient.  immunological and physiological factors that might favor this selective growth are discussed.

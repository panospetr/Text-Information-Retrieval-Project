 1162. electron microscopy of the bovine lungs  the blood-air barrier in acute pulmonary emphysema electron microscopic studies of experimentally induced acute pulmonary emphysema in 2 cows yielded the following findings alveolar epithelial edema and cytolysis, endothelial 'thinning' and cytolysis, excessive elastic and collagenous alveolar wall fibrosis, hyperplasia of alveolar wall smooth muscle, numerous intraalveolar lattice and lamellar bodies, hyaline membrane formation, hypertrophied endothelial perikaryons, numerous alveolar macrophages, and alveolar epithelial secretion of an electron-dense amorphous mass. it was postulated that the lattice and lamellar bodies were a result of degenerating alveolar epithelial cells.

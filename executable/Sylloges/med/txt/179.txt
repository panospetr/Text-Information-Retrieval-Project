 bacteriophages that lyse mycobacteria and corynebacteria, and show cytopathogenic effect on tissue cultures of renal cells of cercopithecus aethiops.. a preliminary communication . bacteriophages isolated from sputum and resection specimens of patients suffering from carcinoma of the lung were found to lyse corynebacteria and mycobacteria, and to produce a cytopathogenic effect on certain cells in tissue cultures . from the same and other patients with neoplastic disease, bacteria were isolated and described as coryne-mycobacteria because of bacteriological features they shared with both species . these bacteria, which either were sensitive to mycobacteriophages and corynebacteriophages or were phage-immune lysogenic bacteria, could be induced to produce lytic particles with phagolytic activity on corynebacteria and mycobacteria and a cytopathogenic effect on hela cells and on the renal cells of cercopithecus .

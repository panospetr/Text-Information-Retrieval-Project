 2373. factors influencing the induction of enhancement and resistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumours in a syngeneic system active immunological enhancement of the growth of methylcholanthrene-induced tumors was demonstrated in a syngeneic system in mice.  enhancement was detected 3-5 wk. after preimmunization with irradiated tumor suspension and was succeeded after the 6th wk. by the development of resistance to the tumor.  analysis by means of adoptive and passive transfer showed these to be true immunological phenomena. enhancement and resistance were transferred by serum and by the lymph node cells of preimmunized mice.  threshold doses of tumor cells were found to be the most satisfactory for the detection of resistance and enhancement in this system.

 differentiation of explanted fragments of early chick blastoderm ii. culture on protein-deficient medium enriched with rna posterior fragments of head process blastoderms were cultured in vitro for two days on a protein-deficient medium supplemented with various rna's, after which they were grafted over the chorio-allantoic membrane for eight to nine days. pancreatic (adult) rna enhanced the development of the entodermal epithelium. heart (adult) rna caused hyperplasia of the epidermis with, in some cases, keratinized papillary projections. brain (embryonic) rna produced a papillomatous epidermis with giant epidermal cysts that were keratinized and fibrillar as in feather formation. liver (embryonic) rna had no visible tissue modifications. in the controls there was no keratinization, nor papillary formation of the epidermis.  the epidermal cysts were very small, unkeratinized and devoid of fibrillar organization. the results are discussed in terms of relationships of proteins from brain, muscle and skin.

 10642. the effects of antioxidants on high pressure oxygen toxicity several commonly used antioxidants have been tested for their effect against poisoning due to high pressures of oxygen (ohp). the tests used were preconclusive period and survival time of mice at 5 atm absolute oxygen, lung damage in rats exposed to 5 atm oxygen for 1 hr., and post ohp paralysis in rats following deep pentobarbital-na anesthesia and ohp at 4 atm for 30 min.  2,5-bis (1,1-dimethylpropyl) hydroquinone gave excellent protection against ohp toxicity in all tests, and several other antioxidants also protected against ohp toxicity but their potency and effectiveness varied for the different criteria of oxygen poisoning tested in the experiments.

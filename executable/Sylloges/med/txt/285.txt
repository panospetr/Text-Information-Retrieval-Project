 4. mixed hematopoietic and pulmonary origin of 'alveolar macrophages' as demonstrated by chromosome markers the origin of alveolar macrophages was investigated in mouse chimeras in which the hematopoietic cells could be identified by marker chromosomes.  by chromosome analysis it was found that in both normal lungs and in lungs exposed to an irritant, approximately twothirds of the dividing cells which could be recovered by lung washing arose from the hematopoietic system and one-third were of pulmonary origin.

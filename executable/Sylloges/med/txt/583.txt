 hyperplastic lesions of mouse mammary glands after treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene hyperplastic lesions were present in the mammary glands of mice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene and exogenous hormones.  the lesions were similar to those found in glands that were exposed to mammary tumor virus.  it is probable that the production of mammary gland hyperplastic lesions could serve as a measure of the effectiveness of a chemical compound as a carcinogenic agent for the mammary gland.

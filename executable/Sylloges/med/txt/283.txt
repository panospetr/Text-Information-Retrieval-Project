 903. lattice structures and osmiophilic bodies in the developing respiratory tissue of rats osmiophilic inclusions have been observed in the lungs of rats particularly in the 20-day rat embryo and newborn up to 3 days post partum.  these inclusions are present in the large alveolar cells as dense laminated structures of variable size and configuration.  they generally consist of concentrically arranged membranes and have the appearance of myelin figures, usually with a dense center.  these osmiophilic inclusions are frequently seen in direct contact with the cell membranes and the alveolar space.  the alveolar space contains numerous osmiophilic myelin figures which are thought to originate from the intracellular osmiophilic inclusions.  they may extrude through a channel formed inside the cell or by rupture of the cell membrane.  secretion materials may occasionally be seen in the cytoplasm of the large alveolar epithelial cells.  these cells appear to be in the process of degeneration.  their cell surfaces are disrupted and the cytoplasm is continuous with materials in the air space.  the lattice structure in the alveolar space may originate from the cytoplasmic secretion material.  the cytoplasmic secretion material in the cell and the lattice structures in the air space disappear after the rats are 3 days old.

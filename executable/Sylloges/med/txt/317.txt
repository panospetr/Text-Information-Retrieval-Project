 1642. electrode catheters and the diagnosis of ebstein's anomaly of the tricuspid valve the successful surgical treatment of ebstein's anomaly calls for accurate pre-operative assessment of the nature and severity of the tricuspid valvular lesion.  the increased risk of cardiac catheterization in this condition has been matched by increased experience of intracardiac techniques, and provided the examination is in skilled hands, patients with ebstein's anomaly should be investigated in the same way as those with any other serious congenital heart lesion for whom surgery is contemplated.  the diagnostic value of electrode catheters is discussed, and the intracardiac electrocardiographic features of ebstein's anomaly are illustrated.  false positive and false negative records are demonstrated and the mechanism of their production is explained.  it is concluded that, though helpful, intracardiac electrocardiographic evidence should be regarded as confirmatory rather than diagnostic. records made with electrode catheters during cardiac catheterization should be considered only along with the other clinical, electrocardiographic, and radiological features of the case, and should not be relied upon as the definitive method in the diagnosis of ebstein's anomaly.

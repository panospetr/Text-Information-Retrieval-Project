 human growth hormone clinical measurement, response to hypoglycemia and suppression by corticosteroids a standard test of growth-hormone secretory capacity, based on radioimmunoassay of plasma growth hormone after insulin hypoglycemia, is described.  in normal subjects a standard insulin tolerance test, causing an average blood glucose drop to 34 per cent of resting values, produced a mean rise in growth hormone to 45.2 millimicrogm. per milliliter at one hour, with a total range of 25 to 70 millimicrogm. per milliliter.  no response was observed in 5 hypopituitary subjects. under comparable hypoglycemic stimulation glucocorticoid-treated patients showed a marked inhibition of the growth-hormone response, which was related to dose.  subjects receiving more than 60 mg. of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean plasma rise to 6.7 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 1.5 to 13 millimicrogm.).  subjects receiving 20 to 60 mg. of cortisol equivalent per day showed a mean rise to 16.6 millimicrogm. per milliliter (range, 13 to 20 millimicrogm.). inhibition of human growth hormone was also affected by duration of glucocorticoid treatment, being greater with long-term than with short-term administration.

 infantile autism and the schizophrenias in a paper published in 1943, entitled "autistic disturbances of affective contact," i reported from the children's psychiatric service of the johns hopkins hospital observations of 11 children (8 boys and 3 girls) who had in common a pattern of behavior not previously considered in its striking uniqueness.  the symptoms were viewed as a combination of extreme aloneness from the beginning of life and an anxiously obsessive desire for the preservation of sameness.  i concluded the discussion by saying: "we must assume that these children have come into the world with an innate inability to form the usual, biologically provided affective contact with people, just as other children come into the world with innate physical and intellectual handicaps.  if this assumption is correct, a further study of our children may help to furnish concrete criteria regarding the still diffuse notions about the constitutional components of emotional reactivity.  for here we seem to have pure-culture examples of inborn autistic disturbances of affective contact." in my search for an appropriate designation, i decided in 1944, after much groping, on the term early infantile autism, thus accentuating the time of the first manifestations and the children's limited accessibility.

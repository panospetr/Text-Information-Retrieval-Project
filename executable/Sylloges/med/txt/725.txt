 urinary excretion of i131-diodrast injected intraventricularly in communicating hydrocephalus and aqueduct stenosis nine cases of expansive infantile hydrocephalus were investigated by injecting small amounts of i131-diodrast intraventricularly.  urinary excretion of the tracer was determined during the first 4-5 hours after injection.  the cumulative excretion of diodrast from the c.s.f. differs in cases with communicating hydrocephalus from those with stenosis of the aqueduct.  the investigation is rapid and easily performed and has not produced any side effects.

 coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and generalized amyloidosis in mice following transmission of subcellular leukemic material following transmission with cell-free supernatant fluid or with virus extract of leukemic tissue or plasma from various types of murine plasma cell leukemias a disease developed, characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia, weight loss, anemia, marked splenic, renal and hepatic amyloidosis and plasma cell infiltrations in the lungs. the disease was also transmissible through the placenta or with the milk of infected mice.  in dba/2 males the incidence of the disease was much higher (100%), the survival shorter and the anemia much more severe than was the case in dba/2 females and in (dba/2 x cba) f1 mice of both sexes.  it is proposed that the development of the lesions is mediated through an autoimmune mechanism created by the antigenic effect of the virus-transformed host cells.
